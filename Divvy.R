# Identifying the need and feasibility (revenue) for new stations 
# between 2 stations for providing parking spaces at heavy traffic stations. 
# This is to ensure that divvy does not lose customers, based on the parking docks unavailability.

# Heavy stations are identified as stations from where most trips start and most trips end and not
# whose dock capacity is initially larger because we need to identify stations which are the busiest.
